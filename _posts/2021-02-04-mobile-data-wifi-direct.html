Do you know that a Wi-Fi option of your phone will enable the phone to use
mobile data to access the Internet while being connected to your dash cam Wi-Fi
(or other no-Internet Wi-Fi networks)?
</p>

<p>
In the recent few years we've witnessed the trend of more and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a>
enabled devices. If you connect to your gadget with a Wi-Fi provided by it, you
are using Wi-Fi Direct. Dash cam is a perfect use case for Wi-Fi Direct. Since
Wi-Fi Direct provides more bandwidth than Bluetooth, it allows you to connect to
your dash cam to get a live view of the camera or download videos.
</p>

<p>
However, it can be annoying if the mobile phone loses Internet access whenever
you are in the car simply because the phone is connected to the no-Internet dash
cam Wi-Fi. I myself ran into this situation a couple of years go when I bought
and installed a Hikvision dash cam. Although turning WLAN off/on on the phone
whenever I get in/off my car would keep me connected to the Internet, it is not
a solution at all because a) the phone is <b>not</b> connected to the Internet and
the dash cam simultaneously; b) It is tedious and I tend to forget to do so. I
ended up deleting the dash cam Wi-Fi from my phone. Even since then, I never
connected to the dash cam to check anything as I am too lazy to re-enter the
dash cam Wi-Fi password into the phone. The dash cam just runs for years like a
black box. Recently, after a road trip I wanted to download a few video clips
from the dash cam but it was too late as they were already overwritten. Thinking
that I might have downloaded them in time should the connection between the
phone and the dash cam is readily available, I started to search for solutions
again and did find one.
</p>

<p>
A quick google found me that some iPhone users had no this issue at all, i.e.
their iPhones could access the Internet while being connected to dash cams. This
is really encouraging because, if iPhones can do it, Andriod phones may also
capable of it. So I continued the research and finally found the solution for
me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I toggled on <b>Automation switch to mobile data</b> On my mobile phone <b>OnePlus 7</b>
as shown in the attached screenshots. This enables my phone to access the
Internet using mobile data while it is connected to the dash cam Wi-Fi.
</p>

<p>
If I understand Google correctly, on different phones this option can locate
in different places and have different names. I <b>suspect</b> any of these two
options also works if it is available: <b>Smart Network Switch</b> or <b>Adaptive
Wi-Fi</b>. For iPhone, the equivalent option should be <b>Settings &gt; Cellular &gt;
Wi-Fi Assist</b> or <b>Settings &gt; Mobile Data &gt; Wi-Fi Assist</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
I upgraded the dash cam APP (<b>HikDashCam</b> released by <b>hikauto</b>) to the latest
version (2.0.2) from version 1.7.4. This version of APP connects to the dash
cam correctly using the dash cam Wi-Fi with the above option turned on.
</p>

<p>
Before upgrading the APP, it somehow could not connect to the dash cam even
though the phone is connected to the dash cam Wi-Fi. I guess it used mobile
data as other application did while it should use the dash cam Wi-Fi dedicated
to it. The version 2.0.2 works as expected.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, if you are in a similar situation, I'd suggest you try the same:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turn on the option <b>Automation Switch to mobile data</b> (or the similar).</li>
<li>Upgrade corresponding APP to the latest version if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another takeaway is: if your priority is to connect to a Wi-Fi Direct device
(for initial configuration etc.) but failed, you may want to try the following
in turn.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turn <b>off</b> mobile data temporarily.</li>
<li>Toggle <b>off</b> the aforementioned option temporarily.</li>
<li>Upgrade the APP.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any comments.
