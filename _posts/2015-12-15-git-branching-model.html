Above digram illustrates the git branching model from a release manager's
perspective. Basically,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The "master" branch is always stable (it is not necessary, but helps to
understand the topology).
</li>

<li>A release branches off from the master for release development.
</li>

<li>Code changes are merged back (<code>git merge --no-ff</code>) when development is
finished.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NOTE: Once a branch diverges from the master branch (i.e. it is no longer
the "current" release), code changes are no longer merged back. For
example:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>rel-2.6 code is not back-ported to master once rel-2.6 is delivered and
rel-3.0 is cut.
</li>
<li>If there is a rel-2.5.x branch, its code is merged to rel-2.5 but not
master.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The release branch is left open for <b>bug fixes only</b>.
</li>

<li>Bug fixes go into the release branch <b>and</b> <code>cherry-pick</code> into all other
applicable branches.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Master branch does not <code>cherry-pick</code> bug fixes, as it will get the fixes
eventually by merging currently developing release branch later.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A sub-release branches off the release branch in a similar way if new
features are needed after the delivery of that release.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Naming convention:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Branches
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Release branches: rel-&lt;release number&gt;. For example: rel-2.5, rel-2.0.1
</li>
<li>Feature branches: fid-&lt;feature id&gt;. For example: fid-14894
</li>
<li>Bug branches: bug-&lt;ticket number&gt;.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tags
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Release tags: tag-rel&lt;release number&gt;. Example: tag-rel2.5
</li>
<li>Daily build/smoke test tags: tag-&lt;release number&gt;-&lt;build number&gt;. Example:
tag-2.5-b85
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
