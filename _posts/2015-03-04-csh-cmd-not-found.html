title: When CSH tells you "Command not found", it doesn't always mean that

<p>
Yesterday, I was working on a newly set-up environment and was blocked for quite
a while by a small issue. The issue is that when I ran a command (say "mycmd")
in CSH (I had to), CSH always reported <code>./mycmd: Command not found</code>. But,
obviously the command was there.
</p>
<pre class="example">
[root@CSH ~]# ./mycmd
./mycmd: Command not found.
</pre>

<p>
At last, I happened to run it in my default shell BASH. Then, I was instantly
reminded that I am running a 32-bit program on 64-bit platform without dependent
libraries.
</p>
<pre class="example">
[root@BASH ~]# ./mycmd
-bash: ./mycmd: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>
What a pity that CSH had given such a misleading information. It seems to me
that we shall avoid using CSH unless "being forced" to do so. What's your
opinion?
