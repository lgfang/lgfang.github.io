<pre class="example">
&gt; 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
&gt; 0.1 + 1 - 1
0.10000000000000009

irrelevant.

In the decimal system, all fractions are a mantissa m divided by a power of 10:
<code>m/10e</code>.
</p>

<p>
So, in the denominator, there are only tens. That's why 1/3 cannot be expressed
precisely as a decimal floating-point number—there is no way to get a 3 into the
denominator. Binary floating-point numbers only have twos in the denominator.
Let’s examine which decimal floating-point numbers can be represented well as
binary and which can't. If there are only twos in the denominator, the decimal
number can be represented:
</p>
<pre class="example">
0.5dec = 5/10 = 1/2 = 0.1bin
0.75dec = 75/100 = 3/4 = 0.11bin
0.125dec = 125/1000 = 1/8 = 0.001bin
</pre>

<p>
Other fractions cannot be represented precisely, because they have numbers other
than 2 in the denominator (after prime factorization):
</p>
<pre class="example">
0.1dec = 1/10 = 1/(2x5)
0.2dec = 2/10 = 1/5
</pre>

<p>
You can't normally see that JavaScript doesn't store exactly 0.1 internally. But
you can make it visible by multiplying it with a high enough power of 10:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt; 0.1 * Math.pow(10, 24)
1.0000000000000001e+23
</pre>

<p>
And if you add two imprecisely represented numbers, the result is sometimes
imprecise enough that the imprecision becomes visible:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt; 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
&gt; 0.1 + 1 - 1
0.10000000000000009
</pre>

<p>
Due to rounding errors, as a best practice you should not compare nonintegers
directly. Instead, take an upper bound for rounding errors into consideration.
Such an upper bound is called a machine epsilon. The standard epsilon value for
double precision is <code>2e−53</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
var EPSILON = Math.pow(2, -53);
function epsEqu(x, y) {
    return Math.abs(x - y) &lt; EPSILON;
}
</pre>

<p>
<code>epsEqu()</code> ensures correct results where a normal comparison would be
inadequate:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt; 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3
false
&gt; epsEqu(0.1+0.2, 0.3)
true
</pre>
