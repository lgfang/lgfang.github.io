<p>
The meaning of "protected" seems to be quite simple and straight-forward:
protected members can be accessed by either the same class or classes derived
from the class. But in fact, it might be more complicated then you might have
thought.
</p>

<p>
Can you explain the compilation result of the following C++ code, especially the
two "Base" related functions.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c++"><span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">Base</span>
{
  <span class="org-keyword">protected</span>:
    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">f</span>() <span class="org-keyword">const</span> { cout &lt;&lt; <span class="org-string">"f"</span> &lt;&lt; endl;}
    <span class="org-keyword">static</span> <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">sf</span>() { cout &lt;&lt; <span class="org-string">"sf"</span> &lt;&lt; endl;}
};

<span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">D1</span> :<span class="org-keyword">public</span> <span class="org-type">Base</span>
{
};

<span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">D2</span> : <span class="org-keyword">public</span> <span class="org-type">Base</span>
{
  <span class="org-keyword">public</span>:
    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_self</span>() <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        <span class="org-keyword">this</span>-&gt;f();              <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">ok</span>
    }

    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_self</span>(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">D2</span><span class="org-warning">&amp;</span> <span class="org-variable-name">d2</span>) <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        d2.f();                 <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">ok</span>
    }

    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_base</span>(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">Base</span><span class="org-warning">&amp;</span> <span class="org-variable-name">b</span>) <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        b.f();                  <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">error</span>
    }

    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_base_sf</span>(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">Base</span><span class="org-warning">&amp;</span> <span class="org-variable-name">b</span>) <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        b.sf();                 <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">ok</span>
    }

    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_d1</span>(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">D1</span><span class="org-warning">&amp;</span> <span class="org-variable-name">d1</span>) <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        d1.f();                 <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">error</span>
    }

    <span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">call_d1_sf</span>(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">D1</span><span class="org-warning">&amp;</span> <span class="org-variable-name">d1</span>) <span class="org-keyword">const</span>
    {
        d1.sf();                <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">error</span>
    }

};
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following words from The Java Programming Language (3e) (by Ken Arnold et
al) reveal what "Protected" really means in java. It also holds true for C++.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; a protected member can also be accessed from a class through object
references that are of at least the same type as the class &#x2013; that is,
references of the class's type or one of its subtypes. &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The reasoning behind the restriction is this: Each subclass inherits the
contract of the superclass and expands that contract in some way. Suppose that
one subclass, as part of its expanded contract, places some constraints on the
values of protected member of the superclass. If a different subclass could
access the protected members of objects of the first subclass then it could
manipulate them in a way that would break the first subclass's contract &#x2013; and
this should not be permissible. Protected static members can be accessed in any
extended class. &#x2026; This is allowed because a subclass can't modify the contract
of its static members as it can only hide them, not override them &#x2013; hence there
is no danger of another class violating that contract.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The C++ Programming Language special ed also has some words on this topic:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A derived class can access a base class protected members only for objects of
its own type.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
This prevents subtle errors that would otherwise occur when one derived class
corrupts data belonging to other derived classes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Above words give insight into the "protected" mechanism. However, you'd better
make sure you really need a "protected" member. Generally speaking, "protected"
is not a good choice. I remember that Bjarne Stroustrup had more words on that
topic in The Design and Evolution of C++
