<p>
<a href="http://www.flycheck.org/">Flycheck</a> is a great Emacs extension for on-the-fly syntax check. It is easy to
configure, use, and extend. With <a href="http://www.shellcheck.net/about.html">shellcheck</a> as the backend, it worked perfectly
for my shell scripts until recently. The other day, I was not able to enable
flycheck for a shell script. After some test, it is clear that flycheck only
cannot handle ksh scripts. Luckily, the code of <code>flycheck.el</code> was very easy to
follow. After digging into it, I soon figured out the root cause and a simple
solution.
</p>

<p>
The root cause is that, when using shellcheck as backend, flycheck supports
ksh88 while ksh are mapped to pdksh (public domain ksh). Furthermore, as the
code snippet indicates, this issue occurs only on Linux boxes.

       (sh5 . sh)))
  <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
  )
</pre>

<p>
The "fix" is quite straightforward. And, it doesn't involve any modification of
flycheck. Instead, I simply customize the <code>sh-alias-alist</code> by putting the
following lines into my Emacs init file.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
  (setq sh-alias-alist
        '((csh . tcsh)
          (ksh . ksh88)                 <span class="org-comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="org-comment">flycheck doesn't handle pdksh</span>
          (bash2 . bash)
          (sh5 . sh))))
</pre>
</div>
