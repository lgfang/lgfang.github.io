<p>
Last week, per the request of a friend at work, I wrote several functions to
enable one to hide or show entries in cscope buffer according to given regexp.
This feature might be helpful when dealing with really large projects. Those who
are interested in this feature as well can find the source-code
"cscope-filter.el" in my github repository: <a href="https://github.com/lgfang/elisp">https://github.com/lgfang/elisp</a>
