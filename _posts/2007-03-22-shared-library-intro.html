<p>
In UNIX-like systems, shared libraries are what are called dynamic linked
libraries in MS windows. They are usually named as "libXXX.so" where "XXX" is
library name. The extension ".so" stands for Shared Object.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Creating SO</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
First, the ".o" files should be Position-Independent Code (PIC). This is
achieved by compiling them with option "-fpic":
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]gcc -c -fpic shared1-1.c
</pre>

<p>
Then, combine all ".o" files we want into one SO file. In fact, it should be
something done by ld. But we needn't call ld directly. gcc will do it for us.
So the command would be some like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]gcc -shared -o libmyshared.so shared1-1.o
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Compiling Executables with SO</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
There are two ways to compile executables with SO.
</p>

<p>
One is to compile just as if the shared libraries are normal object files.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]gcc caller.o libmyshared.so
</pre>

<p>
However, a more common way is to use "-l" option to specify libraries to be
linked.
</p>

<pre class="example">
gcc caller.o -L. -lmyshared
</pre>

<p>
In above example, ld will search for libmyshared.so in its path list. Since I
put libmyshared.so to a non-standard location, I have to use "-L." to add path
to libmyshared.so (current path in this example) to path list of ld.
</p>

<p>
If libmyshared.so is not found, it will search for libmyshared.a. If there are
both libmyshared.so and libmyshared.a, we may use option "-static" to enforce
static linking.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Running  Executables</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now that we have an executable a.out which need libmyshared.so at run time,
the problem becomes: where to find SOs at run time? Generally speaking, a
linker would search for SOs among following paths:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Default/trusted directories such as /lib and /usr/lib
<pre class="example">
ld --verbose | grep -i search
</pre>
</li>
<li>paths specified in /etc/ld.so.conf (if it exists, <code>man ldconfig</code> for more
information)
</li>
<li>paths specified by environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

[/home/lungangfang/tmp]./a.out
./a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libmyshared.so: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/lungangfang/tmp/
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]./a.out
From SO 1-1
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-4">Avoid Version Conflict</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
So far, we've learn basic usage of SO. But, what if we released several
versions of same shared library and they are all being used by some programs?
</p>

<p>
That involves veresioning of SOs. In general, the procedure is some like:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When building SOs, Set version (<code>DT_SONAME</code>) for them;
</li>
<li>Build executables as usual. However, the output executables will be a
little different since the SOs are different: the executables will contain
the <code>DT_SONAME</code> of SOs they linked to when building.
</li>
<li>At run time, executables will be linked to SOs according to major release
version indicated by <code>DT_SONAME</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Naming Rule</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
I've said shared libraries are usually named as "libXXX.so" for simplicity.
But in fact, they can be named as "libXXX.so.maj.min", where "XXX" is library
name, "maj" is major release version number, "min" is the subversion number
(minor version) of that major release. "maj" and "min" are optional.
Following are some valid SO names.
</p>

<pre class="example">
libcap.so
libcap.so.1
libcap.so.1.10
libcrypto.so.0.9.7a
libattr.so.1.0.1
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Building SO with Version Enabled</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libmyshared.so.2 \
-o libmyshared.so.2.2 shared2-2.o
</pre>

<p>
<code>-Wl</code> means following options should be passed to ld. Please be noted the
options are delimited by comma (",") to distinguish them from other fields.
</p>

<p>
Put it all in together, the command would do following for us:
</p>

<p>
Generate an SO file named "libmyshared.so.2.2" and set its major release
number to "libmyshared.so.2" (set <code>DT_SONAME</code> of libmyshared.so.2.2 to
"libmyshared.so.2").
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Organizing SO Files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
We have to organize SO files of same library in following way:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are SO files named as "libXXX.so.maj.min". Each of them is a release
of the library.
</li>
<li>There are SO files named as "libXXX.so.maj". They are usually symbolic
links to latest subversion of each major release. Thus, when linking to
"libXXX.so.maj", we always get the latest subversion of that major
release.
</li>
<li>A SO named as "libXXX.so". That file is usually a symbolic link to latest
"libXXX.so.maj" so that we always get latest version of "libXXX" when
building executables with "-lXXX" or run executables without version
information.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following is an example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[/home/lungangfang/tmp]ls -l lib* | cut -b60-
libmyshared.so -&gt; libmyshared.so.2
libmyshared.so.1 -&gt; libmyshared.so.1.2
libmyshared.so.1.1
libmyshared.so.1.2
libmyshared.so.2 -&gt; libmyshared.so.2.2
libmyshared.so.2.1
libmyshared.so.2.2
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">Building Executables with Version Enabled</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
There is nothing special. You just make sure the SOs you are using contains
version info (<code>DT_SONAME</code>). Then, the output executables are SO version
enabled.
</p>

<pre class="example">
/lib64 $ readelf -d libc.so.6 | grep SONAME
0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libc.so.6]
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-5">Running Executables with Version Enabled</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">
<p>
When running, the executables will be to linked to SOs as usual except that
"libXXX.so.maj" instead of "libXXX.so" is looked for. For example, if you
build a.out with libmyshared.so.1.1, SO file libmyshared.so.1 will be needed
to run a.out because we set <code>DT_SONAME</code> of libmyshared.so.1.1 to
"libmyshared.so.1" when we building it. Once we upgraded myshared to
libmyshared.so.1.2, we just re-link libmyshared.so.1 to libmyshared.so.1.2.
From then on, a.out will be linked to the new version of myshared at run
time.

<p>
GNU libtool is a generic library support script. Libtool hides the
complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable

<li>There is a more flexible way to use shared libraries. man dlopen, dlerror,
