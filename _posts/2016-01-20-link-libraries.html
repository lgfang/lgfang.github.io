<p>
How do UNIX linkers work with archive libraries, and why the order of objects
and libraries on the link line matters.
</p>

<p>
I originally wrote this article in 2001 in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.gcc.help/topics">gnu.gcc.help</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.gcc.help/msg/c1ed29766d6a5a7d?dmode=source">link</a> to it.
</p>

<p>
Since then, I had to refer many people to it, and so decided that a local copy
(with a shorter URL) is in order.
</p>

<p>
Here it is [slightly edited for clarity on 2006-01-10]:

<p>
You are not alone: I see many people who do
</p>
<pre class="example">
gcc -lfoo main.o
</pre>

<p>
Sometimes these problems can get resolved by changing the order of the linked
libraries.
</p>

<p>
What causes these errors? Why can it be resolved by rearranging - does this
mean, that all includes, definitions, declarations etc. are correct ?
</p>

<p>
I find the following analogy most useful when explaining how the linker works
with archive libraries:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>think of an archive library as a bookshelf, with some books on it (the
separate .o files).
</li>

<li>some books may refer you to other books (via unresolved symbols), which may be
on the same, or on a different bookshelf.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A librarian comes to the first bookshelf (the first archive library on your link
line) with two lists &#x2013; a list of things she still needs (unresolved symbols),
and a list of things she already has (symbols already defined).
</p>

<p>
Usually, she will already have crt0.o (added to the link line by the compiler
driver), which refers to main. So her "need" list contains main. Often she will
have main.o as well, which means she no longer needs main, but probably needs
malloc, free, printf, etc.
</p>

<p>
Now she starts to scan one bookshelf at a time looking for books that define
symbols she needs. If a book defines one of the symbols on the "need" list, she
takes that book from the shelf, scratches off all symbols defined in that book
from the "need" list, adds all defined symbols to the "have" list, and adds all
symbols used by that book and not already in the "have" list to the "need" list.
</p>

<p>
If a book does not define any symbols currently in the "need" list, she does not
take it (even though this book may come in handy later).
</p>

<p>
If a book she just took defines a symbol she already has, there is
"multiply-defined symbol" problem.
</p>

<p>
If she took any books from the current shelf, she re-scans the shelf again,
looking for more books to take (because the books she just took may need other
books on the current shelf).
</p>

<p>
Once there are no more books she needs on the current shelf, she is done with
that shelf, and she does not return to it (unless the library corresponding to
it is listed on the command line several times).
</p>

<p>
If, after searching all the bookshelves listed on command line (as well as libc
which is added by the compiler driver), she still has entries in the "need"
list, there is an "undefined symbol" error.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, if many of your biology books refer to chemistry books, and you've got
a biology paper to write, you better start searching the biology bookshelf
before the chemistry one.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, two archive libraries are inter-dependent: objects from one depend on
objects from the other, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
This means, that there is no correct order of linking such libraries, that both
libraries are poorly structured, and that in order to successfully link an
executable, you may need to list both of these libraries several times, as in:
</p>

<pre class="example">
gcc main.o -lfoo -lbar -lfoo -lbar -lfoo
</pre>


<p>
Jane Anderson (j.anderson@geac.com) adds, that on systems using GNU ld one can
use the &#x2013;start-group and &#x2013;end-group command-line options to work around such
inter-library dependencies:
</p>

<pre class="example">
gcc main.o '-Wl,-(' -lfoo -lbar '-Wl,-)'
</pre>

<p>
Finally, there is no reason a linker could not pass over all the objects and
libraries twice: first to build the two lists, then to actually pull all the
needed .o files from their libraries.
</p>

<p>
This is certainly user-friendly (you never get the types of errors that could be
solved by rearranging library order).
</p>

<p>
I believe 2-pass linkers were common some 10-20 years ago. I believe the reasons
they are not used much anymore are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>they consume twice the amount of I/O and significant additional amounts of
memory, and
</li>

<li>they force users with well-structured libraries (who can and do arrange them
properly on the link line) to pay this price so that users with
poorly-structured libraries can still link successfully.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The linker on AIX is the only UNIX linker I know that uses a 2-pass approach.

There is a good <span class="underline">Linkers and Loaders</span> book by John R. Levine. An early draft of
it is available <a href="http://www.iecc.com/linker/">online</a>.
