title: Why "volatile"

<p>
The meaning of "volatile" is: Don't assume that variable won't vary, re-read it
every time using it. I thought it was needed only to synchronize accesses of
certain variable in mulit-thread processes. But, there are actually more reasons
to use "volatile".

<h2 id="sec-1">To deter potential inappropriate compilation optimization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Some hardware/compiler may never re-read the variable if the value doesn't
change according to the context (even it may be altered in another thread).
Example from <span class="underline">The Java Programming Language(3rd ed.)</span> Section 10.10 (P.260):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java">currentValue = 5;
<span class="org-keyword">for</span>(;;){
    display.showValue(currentValue);
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
According to above code snippet, the "currentValue" will never change. So the
compiler may optimize generated code so that "currentValue" is replaced by
"5". But that "optimization" can be an error if the "currentValue" would
change in another thread. To avoid such "optimization", we should qualify
"currentValue" with "volatile".

<h2 id="sec-2">When "longjmp" is involved</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This is explained in <span class="underline">Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</span>
section 7.10 subsection "Automatic, Register and Volatile Variables".
The problem is that some variables may be changed after "setjmp" and
before "longjmp".  What are those variables' values after "longjmp"
back to a previous point?  Values of automatic and register variables
are indeterminate.  But automatic variables qualified by "volatile"
are said to be left as it is.
