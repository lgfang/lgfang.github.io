<p>
As a support engineer, it is a good habit and maybe even a company policy to
delete customer logs downloaded to local PCs/laptops once they are no longer
needed. Instead of doing this manaually periodically, you can set up a cron job
similar to the following to do that.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-variable-name">SHELL</span>=/bin/bash
<span class="org-variable-name">LOG_DIR</span>=/Users/lungang.fang/Downloads
<span class="org-variable-name">LOG_DAYS</span>=15

<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">At 12:30pm Mon-Fri, delete files/dirs older than 15 days and create/update timestamp file "LOG_PURGE"</span>
30 12 * * 1-5 find $<span class="org-variable-name">LOG_DIR</span> -mtime +$<span class="org-variable-name">LOG_DAYS</span> <span class="org-string">\(</span> -type f -or <span class="org-string">\(</span> -type d -empty <span class="org-string">\)</span> <span class="org-string">\)</span> -delete &amp;&amp; date &gt; $<span class="org-variable-name">LOG_DIR</span>/LOG_PURGE
</pre>
</div>

<li>This is my implementation of @josh.allan's idea.</li>
<li>Disclaimer: the above source code of cron job is just an example. Modify, test
and apply it at your own risk.</li>
<li>Although <code>launchd</code> appears to the recommended approach to schedule jobs in
MacOS, <code>cron</code> meets our needs perfectly, so just use it for simplicity.</li>
<li>For cron jobs to work in MacOS, <code>cron</code> must be granted full disk access (see
<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/378553/crontab-operation-not-permitted">this post</a> for how to do that).</li>
<li>The job is <b>not</b> scheduled at midnights because, unlike servers, laptops are
most likely sleeping at that time.</li>
<li>I didn't discard stderr (i.e. <code>find ... 2&gt;/dev/null</code>) because I do prefer
getting a system mail in such cases.</li>
<li>Create a file named <code>LOG_PURGE</code> in the log directory mainly to remind myself
that such a cron job exists.</li>
<li>Do not delete non-empty folders even if they are old because subfolders or
files may be new.</li>
</ul>
