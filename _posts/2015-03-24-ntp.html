<p>
Those who work on Linux must already know about NTP (Network Time Protocol) more
or less. Here are several things I'd like to highlight.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ntpd adjust time <b>gradually</b> and almost not observable.

<p>
Basically you can think of it as ntpd does not change time all at once but
instead makes every second longer/shorter a little bit. This way, after a
rather long period, the time will be synced eventually. The reason for
adopting this methodology is that, in production environment, it is not
acceptable to adjust time one second (or more) at a time. This is especially
true for tuning time backward.
</p>
</li>

<li>When the time difference is big enough (say 10 seconds, refer to ntp configure
file for actual value), ntpd will not sync time. In this case, to force ntpd
update local time according to NTP server regardless the time gap, use <code>ntpd
  -gq</code>.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell-script">service ntp stop
ntpd -gq
service ntp start
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li><code>ntpdate</code> is deprecated, use <code>ntpd</code> instead
</li>
</ul>
