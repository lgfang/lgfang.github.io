如前所述，就我的经验而言，充分理解评分标准对于提高雅思写作成绩至关重要。例如
“task response”的分数其实就很好拿。如果因为对评分标准不理解而丢分就太可惜了。本
文内容主要摘抄、整理自 Simon 的博客 (<a href="http://www.ielts-simon.com">http://www.ielts-simon.com</a>)，部分来源于其它
参考资料，也包含我自己的理解。为便于理解，请先参看官方评分标准再来读本文。

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Argument or discussion?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Many people ask me about the difference between an 'argument' (opinion)
essay and a 'discussion' essay. Here's an easy way to think about the
difference:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you argue, you are trying to persuade the other person to agree with
your point of view. You might even get angry!
</li>
<li>When you discuss, you consider different points of view, and nobody gets
angry.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The question should make it very clear what it wants you to do.
</p>

<p>
If it asks you to "discuss", you should write about both sides or two views.
</p>

<p>
If the question asks whether you "agree or disagree", it's asking for <b>your</b>
view. For this type of question, give your opinion in the introduction and
support it in the rest of the essay. Develop an argument that persuades the
reader to agree with you. Note: <b>you can have a strong view or a balanced
view</b> - it's your choice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Discuss both views and give your own opinion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Task 2 questions often ask you to Discuss both views and give your own
opinion. Here's how I structure a 4-paragraph essay for this kind of
question:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Introduction (2 sentences):

<p>
First introduce the topic. I often begin with the phrase "People have
different views about&#x2026;".
</p>

<p>
In the second sentence, mention both views and your own opinion. I often
use the word "although" in this sentence e.g. Although there are good
arguments in favour of&#x2026;, I personally believe that&#x2026;
</p>
</li>

<li>The first view
</li>

<li>The second view (I make it clear that I agree with this view)
</li>

<li>Conclusion: summarise both views and your own opinion
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Discus without opinion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Most discussion essays also ask for your opinion. Sometimes, however, the
question doesn't ask for your opinion. It might just ask you to discuss two
different views, or compare the advantages and disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
Remember: <b>if the question doesn't ask for your opinion, don't give it</b>.
</p>

<p>
Compare the 2 essays attached below. They are almost the same, but in the
first essay I give my opinion clearly in several places, while in the second
essay I've removed my opinions completely.
</p>

<p>
With opinion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route
to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job
straight after school. Discuss both views and <b>give your opinion</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job
or continue their education. While there are benefits to getting a job
straight after school, <b>I would argue that</b> it is better to go to college or
university.
</p>

<p>
The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several
reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible.
In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford
their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people
who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress
more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn
practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to
promotions and a successful career.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, <b>I believe that</b> it is more beneficial for students to
continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in
many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher
or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university
graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to
earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job
market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are
hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do
not have qualifications from a university or college <b>will</b> not be able to
compete.
</p>

<p>
For the reasons mentioned above, <b>it seems to me that students are more
likely to be successful</b> in their careers if they continue their studies
beyond school level.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Without opinion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route
to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job
straight after school. <b>Discuss both views</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Agree, disagree or partly agree?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
When the question asks whether you agree or disagree, you can either express
a strong opinion (completely agree or disagree) or you can express a
balanced opinion (partly agree, or agree to a certain extent).
</p>

<p>
Let's look at two ways to answer the following question:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
After leaving school or university, young people should choose a job or
career that they love, rather than one that pays the best salary. To what
extent do you agree with this statement?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Introduction for a strong opinion

<blockquote>
<p>
Some people make their career choices according to what they enjoy doing,
whereas others place more importance on earning a high salary. Personally,
I support the view that job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment are
much more important than money.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>Introduction for a balanced opinion

<blockquote>
<p>
Some people make their career choices according to what they enjoy doing,
whereas others place more importance on earning a high salary. Personally,
I believe that both criteria should be given equal consideration.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you completely agree or completely disagree:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make your opinion clear in the introduction and conclusion.
</li>

<li>Explain one reason for your opinion in paragraph 2 and another in
paragraph 3. Imagine that you are persuading the examiner that your
opinion is right.
</li>

<li><b>Don't</b> write a paragraph about what 'other people' think. If you do that,
you are in danger of writing a "discuss both views" essay. If you mention
the opposite argument, make sure that you refute it (explain why you think
it's wrong), like I did in paragraph 2 of <i>*foreign tourists</i>.
</li>

<li>Sometimes it's possible to have a strong opinion but still write about
both sides of the argument. Take this question for example:

<blockquote>
<p>
'Teleworking', or the use of telecommunications to allow people to work
from home, should be adopted by all employers in order to improve the
quality of life of their staff. To what extent do you agree or disagree
with this statement?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here's my introduction:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The current trend towards teleworking is a positive one in many respects.
However, I strongly disagree with the idea that it should be introduced in
all work contexts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Can you see how this introduction allows me to write about both the
positives and negatives of teleworking, even though I expressed a strong
opinion? Which word in the question allowed me to do this?
</p>

<p>
The word that I was thinking of is "all". I disagree with the idea of
teleworking in ALL work contexts. This means that I can write one
paragraph about the benefits of teleworking in some work situations, then
another paragraph about the contexts in which I think teleworking would be
a bad idea.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you partly agree:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's important to make it clear in the introduction and conclusion that
you have a balanced view i.e. that you accept both sides of the argument
to some extent.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the last century, the first man to walk on the moon said it was "a
giant leap for mankind”. However, some people think it has made little
difference to our daily lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is often argued that the act of sending a man to the moon has been of
no benefit to normal people. While I agree that this is true in practical
terms, I believe that the psychological impact of this great achievement
should not be underestimated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note: Can you see how I create a balanced answer by using a 'while'
sentence to contrast the 'practical' and 'psychological' impacts of the
moon landing?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for
their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
</p>

<p>
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles
rather than for the work they do. While I agree that these celebrities set
a bad example for children, I believe that other famous people act as
positive role models.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that I use a "while" sentence to express my balanced opinion.
</p>
</li>

<li>Write one paragraph about each side of the argument. But do this from
<b>your</b> point of view e.g. On the one hand, <b>I accept</b> that&#x2026; / On the
other hand, <b>I also believe</b> that&#x2026;
</li>

<li>Don't write a discussion essay e.g. some people believe / other people
argue&#x2026;

<p>
The role of prisons should be to punish criminals who have committed serious
crimes. Training courses and education offered to prisoners are a waste of
taxpayer's money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
</p>

<p>
Note that it contains two sub-topics:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Should the role of prisons be to punish serious criminals, not petty
criminals (less serious criminals)?
</li>
<li>Are training courses and education a waste of money?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The question below contains 2 ideas or statements, highlighted in blue and
green.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Wild animals have no place in the 21st century</b>, so <code>protecting them is a
   waste of resources</code>. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A student, Raymond, asked which part of this question we should answer.
Should we agree or disagree with just the blue part, just the green part, or
both parts?
</p>

<p>
Here's another example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>International travel is cheaper than ever before</b>, and <code>more countries have
   opened their doors to tourists</code>. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh
the disadvantages?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For this question, Raymond asks whether we need to discuss the pros and cons
of travel being cheaper, or whether we should just focus on the green part.
What do you think?
</p>

<p>
The marking criteria states that 'all parts of the question should be fully
addressed'. The challenge sometimes is to actually identify the question
(opinion/proposition) from a 'background statement'. IELTS sometimes gives a
background statement to provide some context for the proposition. Even
examiners occasionally find it hard to do this!
</p>

<p>
In the first question, the blue part is NOT a background statement because
it clearly provides a 'proposition' - to say that something has 'no place'
is expressing an opinion because there is an implied 'should'. Therefore you
would have to address both parts because they are two parts of an opinion.
</p>

<p>
For the second question, both parts refer to changes, so 'the trend' in the
question conceivably refers back to both of them, especially as they are
logically linked. My advice is that if you are not sure, address both of
them and do it equally.

<li>Paragraphing

<p>
Keep introduction and conclusion concise. So that main paragraphs are
relatively long.
</p>

<p>
The "idea, explain, example" format is a good way to organise your main
paragraphs. Start with the main idea of the paragraph, explain it in more
detail, then give an example. A variation on this format is "idea, example,
explain".
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples for main paragraphs:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
On the one hand, criminals do need to be punished in some way. A person who
<b>commits a crime</b> must learn that <b>unlawful actions have consequences</b>.
Prison sentences punish <b>offenders</b> because they <b>lose their freedom</b>, and
are separated from family and friends. In this way, prison <b>acts as a
deterrent</b> to make people think carefully before <b>breaking the law</b>. Last
year in the UK, many people <b>were given a prison sentence</b> for <b>rioting</b>,
and hopefully this punishment will <b>deter them from similar behaviour</b> in
future.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Analysis:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The paragraph contains 5 sentences, with a total of 85 words. This is the
kind of length I suggest aiming for.
</li>

<li>The first sentence is short and simple. We often call this type of sentence
a 'topic sentence' because it introduces the topic of the paragraph.
</li>

<li>Sentences 2, 3 and 4 develop the main idea in a logical, step-by-step way:
crime has consequences - loss of freedom is the punishment - this stops
people from breaking the law.
</li>

<li>Sentence 5 contains a real example.
</li>

<li>Remember that good vocabulary is the key to a high score. I've underlined
the best words and phrases in the paragraph.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
(1) On the other hand, school teachers may contribute almost as much as
parents to the development of a child. (2) Teachers educate large groups of
children together, which means that they must train pupils to work with their
peers and respect other members of the class. (3) Pupils also learn to behave
sensibly in lessons, regardless of the distractions around them, and to
follow instructions given to them by teaching staff. (4) These behavioural
skills will be crucial in later life. (5) In the workplace, for example,
adults are expected to work in teams, listen to each other, and follow the
instructions of a manager or company director.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice how I "build" the paragraph using 5 sentences:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Topic sentence introducing the main idea - the role of teachers in
children's development.
</li>
<li>One aspect of this role - training children to work with others.
</li>
<li>Another aspect of this role - children learn to behave and follow
instructions.
</li>
<li>Why the two points above are important - for later life.
</li>
<li>Examples - work in teams, follow a manager's instructions.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding
change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss
both these views and give your own opinion.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are good reasons why some people feel the need to make significant
changes to their lives from time to time. Firstly, any new situation that a
person encounters can be an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. A new
job, for instance, might present challenges that push the person to adapt,
acquire new knowledge, or add to their skill set. Secondly, a change can
represent a break with the past and an old routine which has become boring
and predictable. Finally, as well as making life more fun and interesting,
new experiences can be good for our physical and mental health.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Task: Analyze this paragraph carefully. What can you learn from it in terms
of structure, ideas, vocabulary and grammar?
</p>
</li>

<li>Logic

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do not have to be profound dose not necessarily mean no logic at all. In
my humble opinion, the primary goal of examiners is exactly looking for
your ability and skill to present logic.
</li>

<li>For example, develop an idea from 'general' to 'specific'.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Position

<p>
要有明确的立场. 议论文里可以两方面观点都讨论，但是自己的观点必须是非常明确的。
讨论时一定要让读者明确的感知到你是支持还是反对当前的观点。前段时间读奥巴马的
“The Audacity of Hope”，里面有一段话生动的展示了怎样做到这一点。可惜当时没有
记下。那一整段是奥巴马引述对手的若干观点。虽然奥巴马没有说“I disagree”之类的
话，但引述每一个观点的同时都让人立刻感知到他是反对这个观点的。
</p>
</li>

<li>Cohesive devices

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Repetition of a Key Term or Phrase

<p>
Repeat a key word throughout the paragraph. This helps to focus your ideas
and to keep your reader on track.
</p>
</li>

<li>Synonyms

<p>
Repeat a key idea in different ways. Synonyms are words that have
essentially the same meaning, and they provide some variety in your word
choices, helping the reader to stay focused on the idea being discussed.
</p>
</li>

<li>Pronouns

<p>
This, that, these, those, he, she, it, they, and we are useful pronouns
for referring back to something previously mentioned. Be sure, however,
that what you are referring to is clear.
</p>
</li>

<li>Transitional Words

<p>
There are many words in English that cue our readers to relationships
between sentences, joining sentences together.
</p>
</li>

<li>Sentence Patterns

<p>
Sometimes, repeated or parallel sentence patterns can help the reader
follow along and keep ideas tied together. For example,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you &#x2013;
ask what you can do for your country.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>A good example

<blockquote>
<p>
Some <code>art projects</code> definitely require help from the <b>state</b>. In <b>the
UK</b>, there are many <code>works of art</code> in public spaces, such as streets or
squares in <b>city centres</b>. In <b>Liverpool</b>, for example, there are several
new <code>statues and sculptures</code> in the <b>docks area of the city</b>, <span class="underline">which</span> has
been redeveloped recently. <i>These</i> <b>artworks</b> represent culture, heritage
and history. <span class="underline">They</span> serve to educate people about the city, and act as
landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and
local councils should pay creative artists to produce <i>this</i> <code>kind of
      art</code>, because without <span class="underline">their</span> funding our cities would be much less
interesting and attractive.
</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Band 9 linking

<p>
If you look at the official band descriptors for writing task 2, you'll
find this phrase in the band 9 description for 'coherence and cohesion':
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So how do you connect your ideas (cohesion) without attracting too much
attention? I think there are 2 possible ways:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Explain your ideas in a logical order so that you don't need many linking
words. This is probably what you do when writing in your own language.
</li>

<li>Use easy linking words like and, but, also, firstly, secondly, finally,
for example. These are so common that they attract almost no attention.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you read the <i>*wild animal</i> essay, you'll notice that I don't "show off"
with long linking phrases. The linking is subtle, and the focus is on
answering the question with good ideas.
