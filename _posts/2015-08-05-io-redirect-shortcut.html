<p>
It is frequently seen in shell scripts that both stdout and stderr are
redirected or piped to the same destination. Do you know that BASH (and some
others) has shortcuts for that? Below is cited from BASH manual.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If <code>|&amp;</code> is used, the standard error of COMMAND1 is connected to COMMAND2's
standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <code>2&gt;&amp;1 |</code>. This implicit
redirection of the standard error is performed after any redirections specified
by the command.

<p>
There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&amp;&gt;WORD
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&amp;WORD
</pre>
<p>
Of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent to
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;WORD 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The format for appending standard output and standard error is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&amp;&gt;&gt;WORD
</pre>
<p>
This is semantically equivalent to
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;WORD 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
