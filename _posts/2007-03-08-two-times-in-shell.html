<p>
<code>time</code> is a Linux/Unix external command. It is also a bash keyword. Both are
used for measuring time spent on certain process. But there are subtle
differences.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious difference is the output format. But more importantly, as an
external command, <code>time</code> takes the program to be run as a parameter. Meanwhile,
the builtin <code>time</code> is a modifier of the program (or pipe) to be run. As
mentioned in man page:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The use of `time' as a reserved word permits the timing of shell builtins, shell
functions, and pipelines. An external `time' command cannot time these easily.
</p>
</blockquote>

Below are some examples:
