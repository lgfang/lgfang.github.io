title: Filtering MongoDB log based on client IP

<p>
Have you encountered the situation that, when reviewing a mongod log file, you'd
like to focus on what operations a particular client (identified by its IP
address) has done but the <code>mongod</code> was so busy that the log file was inundated
with lots of messages/operations from other clients?
</p>

<p>
There is a one-liner to filter MongoDB log files to print the log messages
related to the connection from the specified IP address(es). For example, the
following command lists all operations recorded for connections from localhost
(<code>127.0.0.1</code>):
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ cat mongod.log | gawk '/connection accepted from 127.0.0.1/{open[$9] = 1; print $0}$4~/\[conn/{conn=gensub(/\[conn([0-9]*)\]/, "#\\1", "g", $4); if(conn in open){print $0; if($5=="end" &amp;&amp; $6=="connection"){delete open[conn]}}}'
2020-02-03T15:00:58.087+1100 I NETWORK  [listener] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:63120 #1 (1 connection now open)
2020-02-03T15:00:58.087+1100 I NETWORK  [conn1] received client metadata from 127.0.0.1:63120 conn1: { driver: { name: "PyMongo", ...
2020-02-03T15:00:58.090+1100 I NETWORK  [listener] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:63121 #2 (2 connections now open)
2020-02-03T15:00:58.090+1100 I NETWORK  [conn2] received client metadata from 127.0.0.1:63121 conn2: { driver: { name: "PyMongo", ...
2020-02-03T15:00:58.091+1100 I NETWORK  [conn2] end connection 127.0.0.1:63121 (1 connection now open)
...
</pre>

<p>
If you don't like copying/pasting such a long command line, you can put the awk
part into a file (say <code>ops-per-ip.awk</code>) and run <code>cat mongod.log | gawk -f
ops-per-ip.awk</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-awk"><span class="linenr">1: </span><span class="org-string">/connection accepted from 127.0.0.1/</span>{open[$9] = 1; <span class="org-preprocessor">print</span> $0}
<span class="linenr">2: </span>$4~<span class="org-string">/\[conn/</span>{
<span class="linenr">3: </span>    conn=<span class="org-preprocessor">gensub</span>(<span class="org-string">/\[conn([0-9]*)\]/</span>, <span class="org-string">"#\\1"</span>, <span class="org-string">"g"</span>, $4)
<span class="linenr">4: </span>    <span class="org-keyword">if</span>(conn <span class="org-keyword">in</span> open){
<span class="linenr">5: </span>        <span class="org-preprocessor">print</span> $0;
<span class="linenr">6: </span>        <span class="org-keyword">if</span>($5==<span class="org-string">"end"</span> &amp;&amp; $6==<span class="org-string">"connection"</span>){<span class="org-keyword">delete</span> open[conn]}
<span class="linenr">7: </span>    }
<span class="linenr">8: </span>}
</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Line 1: When a connection from <code>127.0.0.1</code> is accepted, insert the connection
ID with prefix <code>#</code> (<code>#1234</code> for example) into the array <code>open</code>. The value is
set to 1 but is actually irrelevant.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Please note that the source IP does not have to be a single IP address, you
can using any regexp gawk recognizes. For example: use <code>192.168.99.10[56]</code>
to track operations launched from <code>192.168.99.105</code> and <code>192.169.99.106</code>. Or,
use <code>192.168</code> for any IP within the subnet <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Line 2: For other log lines like <code>2020-02-03T15:00:58.087+1100 I NETWORK
  [conn1234] ...</code>, do the following:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Line 3: Use regexp function <code>gensub</code> to get the connection ID <code>1234</code> and
construct the array key, i.e. <code>#1234</code>.</li>
<li>Line 4: If the key exists in <code>open</code>, then this connection is from the IP
address of concern. Therefore,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Line 5: print this log line</li>
<li>Line 6: remove the key from the array if this line denotes the end of the
connection (<code>2020-02-03T15:00:58.091+1100 I NETWORK [conn1234] end
      connection 127.0.0.1:63121...</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the following example, with the help of this command I am able to easily
confirm that the client on <code>192.168.99.100</code> tried to connect many times but it
never tried to authenticate itself and did nothing (or, put it more accurately:
no operations were recorded).
