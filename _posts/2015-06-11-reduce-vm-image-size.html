<p>
Are you aware that, in many cases the size of virtual machine images can be
reduced dramatically. This blog studies a case that reduced the image size of a
VM from 43GB to only 10GB using two techniques in combination. (The actual
compression ratio shall vary from case to case as the contents in the VMs vary).
</p>

<p>
This is a VM under the control of openstack. It has a 43GB hard disk, only 19GB
of which is actually used. We noticed that the image of this virtual machine is
about 33GB, however.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Zero unused blocks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The first technique is to "zero unused blocks". Obviously, openstack employs
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">Sparse File</a> or something alike to store VM images. The basic idea is that, if
a file contains a large amount of continuous zero blocks then we can save much
space by storing meta data of those blocks instead of actually reserve that
much blocks. Therefore, we ran the following commands in the VM to erase
garbage in its file systems.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell-script"><span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">for each file system</span>
dd <span class="org-variable-name">if</span>=/dev/zero <span class="org-variable-name">of</span>=./zero <span class="org-variable-name">bs</span>=1M
rm ./zero
sync
</pre>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first command is to create a file (named "zero") to take all free space,
and this file contains only zero (NULL bytes).
</li>
<li>The remaining two commands are to delete the file and sync changes onto disk.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After running these commands reduced the image size to around 19GB.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Compress image</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The second technique we used is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell-script">qemu-img convert -c original.qcow2 -O qcow2 compressed.qcow2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This reduced the size further to 10GB.
