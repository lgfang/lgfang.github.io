<p>
Amongst a handful of tools which serve a similar goal, I chose pylint. Pylint is
a static analysis tool for python that helps you identify errors in your code
and ensure your follow your coding standard (white-space, naming convention
etc.) This should tremendously boost your productivity as well as improve
quality of your code.
</p>

<p>
This is because:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Pylint finds out "static errors" for you without having to run the code.
</li>
<li>Pylint finds out potential errors, say redefining names, for you.
</li>
<li>Pylint finds out errors in code branches which are hard to covered by test.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For emacsers, you can easily integrate pylint into Emacs to do on-the-fly check.

convenient it is.
