<p>
In real world projects, we often want to monitor multiple log files
Simultaneously. This can be achieved much simpler than opening a handful of
windows and tail one file in each of these windows.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GNU tail

<p>
Now, the GNU tail (tail comes with Linux) supports multiple files as this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell-script">tail -F file1 file2 ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This solution is simple and neat. It does not demand extra libraries or tools.
However, there is a small downside: outputs from all files interleaved. When
the logs scroll really fast, this would make it hard to identify the source
(file) of each line.

</li>

<li>multitail

<p>
Besides the "standard" tail, there is also a 3rd-party tool called <a href="http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/download.php">multitail</a>.
It splits a window into several panes and tail one file per pane. This makes
its output much neater. The only issue is that you do not always have
multitail at hand. "multitail" is not installed by default in most systems and
you may have to install it as well as its dependencies from source code.

</ul>
