Yesterday, a colleague was confronted with a core dump caused by NULL pointer.
But this case was a little unusual and she was confused. Like her, many people
know that accessing address 0x0 (NULL pointer) is illegal and causes core dump
(segment fault). What they do not know is that <b>using</b> NULL pointer does not
necessarily always cause core dump immediately. Sometimes, there is even no core
dump. Here is the example illustrates that.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">f2</span>(<span class="org-type">C</span>* <span class="org-variable-name">pc</span>) {
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
    expression(pc-&gt;m); <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">* &lt;=== the spot when core dump happened</span>
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
}

<span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">f1</span>(){
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
    f2( &amp;(pa-&gt;pb-&gt;c) ); <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">**</span>
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
}

<span class="org-keyword">struct</span> <span class="org-type">A</span>{
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
    <span class="org-keyword">struct</span> <span class="org-type">B</span>* <span class="org-variable-name">pb</span>;
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
};

<span class="org-keyword">struct</span> <span class="org-type">B</span>{
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
    <span class="org-type">C</span> <span class="org-variable-name">c</span>;
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The core file shows that the process crashes in function f2. It seems that the
de-referencing pointer <code>pc</code> caused the core dump. But, the value of <code>pc</code> is not
NULL but <code>0x38</code>. Instead, <code>pb</code> was NULL. This confused my colleague since she
thought the process should have cored in f1.
</p>

<p>
This is a common misunderstanding. Please note that code like <code>&amp;(p-&gt;m)</code> does not
access the member <code>m</code> of <code>p</code>. It just only get the address of <code>m</code>. In c
programming language, this is achieved by adding up the address of <code>p</code> and the
offset of <code>m</code> within the structure. Therefore, it does not matter if the address
<code>p</code> is NULL or not. In fact, it is a widely used technique to get the offset of
structure members as shown below:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c">(<span class="org-type">int</span>) (&amp;(((<span class="org-type">X</span> *)NULLP)-&gt;Y))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, once we find a pointer points to a very small address (no
bigger than structure size) we can be pretty sure that NULL pointer is used
(either intentionally or inadvertently).
