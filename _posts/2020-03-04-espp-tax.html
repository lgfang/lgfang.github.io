<p>
ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan) has become one common method of compensating
employees nowadays. My employer offers this through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Trade">Etrade</a>. Since it is US based
but I live in Australia, I discovered a subtle difference in calculating ESPP
tax between these two countries, which may incur double tax if not handled
correctly.
</p>

<p>
In the US, our ESPP plan is a Qualified Plan, meaning income taxes are deferred
and are only realized when the shares are sold. And, upon selling these shares,
the difference between the Grant Date FMV and the Purchase Date FMV will be
taxed as ordinary income. However, if you the hold the shares longer enough,
only the amount of discount allotted in the plan (such as 15%) is reported as
ordinary income. The remainder is classified as a long-term capital gain. Below
is quoted from <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/12/employee-stock-purchase-plans.asp">Introduction to Employee Stock Purchase Plans â€“ ESPP</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
ESPPs use holding periods that closely resemble those of other stock option
plans. For qualified ESPPs, the stock that is not sold until at least a year
after the purchase date and two years after the offering date will receive
favorable tax treatment. Stock sales that meet these criteria are known as
qualifying dispositions, while those that don't meet these criteria are labeled
as disqualifying dispositions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Qualifying Dispositions</b>
</p>

<p>
Participants who meet the holding requirements for qualifying dispositions will
realize two types of taxable income (or losses), but none of it is reported
until the year of the sale. The amount of discount allotted in the plan (such as
15%) is reported as ordinary income. The remainder is classified as a long-term
capital gain.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In comparison, in Australia, our ESPP is a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Employee-share-schemes/Employers/Types-of-ESS/Concessional-ESS/Tax-deferred-schemes/">Tax-deferred scheme</a>, meaning the
difference between the actual purchase price and the Purchase Date FMV will be
taxed as ordinary income in the year of purchase. The remainder is considered a
capital gain and get 50% discount of tax if you hold the shares for 1+ years:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The deferred taxing point for a share or stapled security is the earliest of the
following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>when there is no real risk of forfeiture and the scheme no longer genuinely
restricts disposal of the share</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To demonstrate the difference, let us assume the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grant Date FMV: $60.00</li>
<li>Purchase Date FMV: $30.00</li>
<li>Actual purchase price: $25.50</li>
<li>Sell (1 year later) price: $80.00</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the US:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taxing point: when you sell the shares
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ordinary income: ($30.00 - $25.50)</li>
<li>Capital gain: ($80.00 - $30.00)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
In AU:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taxing point 1: when the you purchase the shares
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ordinary income: ($60.00 - $25.50)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Taxing point 2: when the you sell the shares
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Capital gain: ($80.00 - $60.00)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The thing needs to watch out is: as an Australian tax resident, when lodging tax
income, remember to use the Purchase Date FMV as the cost basis not the one
listed in the Etrade portal. Otherwise, the difference between $60.00 and $30.00
will be taxed twice:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is firstly taxed upon the purchase as ordinary income, which is correct.</li>
<li>It is taxed again as capital gain when I sell the shares, which is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
