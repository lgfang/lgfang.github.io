<p>
Get backspace working in a mixed environment often involves <code>stty erase ^?</code> (or
<code>stty erase ^h</code>). However, today I found that sometimes they work sometimes they
do not work. This seemed a bug to me at first. But, after more tests, I found it
might be not a bug but a feature.
</p>

<p>
Here is the summary of the behavior of <code>stty erase</code> on redhat linux.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Whatever you set in your profile (default is "^?"), both "^h" and "^?" are
regarded as &lt;erase&gt;.
</li>

<li>A <code>stty erase</code> command takes effect only when it really changes the &lt;erase&gt;.

<p>
For example, if you <code>stty erase ^h</code> in your profile, running <code>stty erase ^h</code>
again in command line does nothing and both "^h" and "^?" still work as
&lt;erase&gt;. But, running <code>stty erase ^?</code> will instantly make "^?" the only erase
character.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, when you find <code>stty erase ^?</code> does not work as expected, run <code>stty erase ^h</code>
first and then retry <code>stty erase ^?</code>.
</p>

<p>
This behavior might be a nice feature. While still keeps the ability to modify
the settings of &lt;erase&gt;, it makes both "^h" and "^?" work as &lt;erase&gt; even if you
"inherit" a profile which set &lt;erase&gt; explicitly, which is very
beginner-friendly.
