<p>
Most BASH programmers know how to redirect stderr of a command. But, what if the
IO redirection itself failed? Though it is not frequently used, capturing
possible error message of IO redirection sometimes can be useful. This can be
done by group the whole commandline (or pipe) and redirect it as shown below.

<pre class="example">
$ date &gt; log_file/doet/not/exist 2&gt;&amp;1
-bash: file/doet/not/exist: No such file or directory

$ msg=$( (date &gt; log_file/doet/not/exist 2&gt;&amp;1) 2&gt;&amp;1)   # &lt;-- error captured:

$ echo $msg
-bash: log_file/doet/not/exist: No such file or directory
</pre>
