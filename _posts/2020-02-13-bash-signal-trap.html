You login a shell and launch a long running script, then quit the shell/terminal
but not sure if the script (and its child processes) will continue running or
not? You try to catch and handle signals in the script but it does work as you
expected? Below are some tests to help you understand these things.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The above is the script (<code>test.sh</code>) I use for the tests:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>3~6</dt><dd>set up traps to print the signal name before exiting the script if one
of the three signals is received.</dd>
<dt>8~13</dt><dd>spawn a Python process to loop infinitely. This to mimic a long
running external command invoked in the script.</dd>
<dt>15~18</dt><dd>an infinitely shell loop.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now, let's start the tests. In each test, I'll run the test script (<code>test.sh</code>)
and then monitor (tail) the output file to check if the processes are terminated
or not.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Fistly, the simplest case, run the script in the foreground: <code>./test.sh
  &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
</p>

<p>
The interactive bash shell sends SIGINT (for Ctrl-c) or SIGHUP (or closing
terminal) to all foreground processes. Therefore, in these two cases, both the
parent process (<code>test.sh</code>) and the child process (<code>python3</code>) will get the
signal and exit:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Press Ctrl-c
</p>
<pre class="example">
Python loop - 2020-02-11 14:51:04.795263
...

</pre></li>
<li><p>
Close the terminal
</p>
<pre class="example">
Python loop - 2020-02-11 14:52:24.618521
Python loop - 2020-02-11 14:52:26.620370
Python loop - 2020-02-11 14:52:28.622768
Hangup: 1                                     &lt;=== from the child
Received SIGHUP                               &lt;=== from the parent
</pre></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
Secondly, run the script in background: <code>./test.sh &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</code>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the processes will continue running upon Ctrl-c because the
interactive shell will <b>not</b> send SIGINT to background processes. But, when
the terminal is closed, they will still receive SIGHUP and abort.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Closing the terminal means closing the terminal directly. Running <code>exit</code> to
quit the shell (so that the terminal emulator close the window
automatically) does not count. In this case, the shell quits actively and
does not receive SIGHUP. Hence it won't send SIGHUP to the script and the
child processes of the script.</li>
<li>You may not observe this behaviour with some terminal emulators. My guess
is: some terminal emulators manage to communicate with the shell session and
close it gracefully when a terminal window is closed. Therefore, the shell
(as well as the script and its child processes) does not receive SIGHUP.
According to my test with OS X, SIGHUP is sent when a terminal is closed in
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> or iTerm2 but that is not case with the builtin Terminal APP.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
Run the script using <code>nohup</code>
</p>

<p>
As the name suggests, <code>nohup</code> makes the spawned process ignore SIGHUP. But
they will <b>not</b> ignore SIGINT. As a result:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If <code>nohup</code> is run in the foreground (<code>nohup ./test.sh</code>), Ctrl-c interrupts
the script. However, closing the terminal will <b>not</b> interrupt the script.</li>
<li>In comparison, if <code>nohup</code> is run in the background (<code>nohup ./test.sh &amp;</code>),
neither Ctrl-C nor closing terminal would interrupt the script.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
What if we edit <code>test.sh</code> to <b>execute the Python process in the background</b>
(i.e. <code>python3 -c '...' &amp;</code>)?
</p>

<p>
In this case, the Python process will be run in the background no matter if
the parent process (i.e. the script) is in the background or not. Therefore,
we'd expect the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Ctrl-c does not affect the Python process but may interrupt the parent
script. 
</p>

<p>
Below is the output of <code>./test.sh &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1</code>. Initially both the parent
process and child process were printing timestamps. Once I pressed Ctrl-c,
the parent process (the loop in the script) was interrupted but the Python
process continued.
</p>
<pre class="example">

</pre></li>

<li><p>
On the other hand, closing terminal still delivers SIGHUP to both the parent
and the child process and interrupts them regardless if the script is
executed in the foreground or not.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Script loop - Tue Feb 11 12:15:10 UTC 2020

</pre></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
What if we remove the <code>while True:</code> loop from the shell script? Does it change
the test results at all when compared with the previous test?
</p>

<p>
This is indeed a very common scenario: the script initialize the environment
for a child process; spawn the long running child process; and then quit.
</p>

<p>
Below is the modified script:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell-script"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">#</span><span class="org-comment">!/usr/local/bin/</span><span class="org-keyword">bash</span>

python3 -c <span class="org-string">'</span>
<span class="org-string">import datetime, time</span>
<span class="org-string">while True:</span>
<span class="org-string">    print("Python loop - %s" % datetime.datetime.now(), flush=True)</span>
<span class="org-string">    time.sleep(2)</span>
<span class="org-string">'</span> &amp;

<span class="org-builtin">echo</span> <span class="org-string">"end of the script"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Launch the above modified script in the foreground and then check the
processes. From the output of <code>ps</code> below, we can see:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parent process (the script) has finished (not in the output).</li>
<li>The child process is reaped by the <code>init</code> process (ppid of it is 1).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
$ ./test.sh &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1

$ ps -eo "pid,ppid,pgid,jobc,command" | egrep -i '(test|python)' | sed 's/ \/.*\// /'
55317     1 55306    0 Python -c \012import datetime, time\012while True:\012    print("Python loop - %s" % datetime.datetime.now(), flush=True)\012    time.sleep(2)\012
...
</pre>

<p>
In comparison, when both the script and the python process keep running, the
currently shell is the parent of the script and the script is the parent of
the spawned process:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ echo $$
53064

$ ps -eo "pid,ppid,pgid,jobc,command" | egrep -i '(test|python)' | sed 's/ \/.*\// /'
53488 53064 53488    1 test.sh
53494 53488 53488    1 Python -c \012import datetime, time\012while True:\012    print("Python loop - %s" % datetime.datetime.now(), flush=True)\012    time.sleep(2)\012
...
</pre>

<p>
The is actually the primary difference and the result is: the interactive
shell will not send any signal to the child, meaning the child process won't
be interrupted by Ctrl-c or closing terminal.
</p></li>

<li><p>
trap
</p>

<p>
Finally let's have a closer look at <code>trap</code>. As you must already know, <code>trap</code>
catches the specified signals and runs according command(s).
</p>

<p>
But, if you run the original script and then send <code>SIGINT</code> to the script using
<code>kill -SIGINT pid_of_script</code>, you'll notice the script does not respond to the
signal.
</p>

<p>
Below is how I ran the test:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ ./test.sh &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;        # &lt;=== run the script
[1] 75519


$ ps -eo "pid,ppid,pgid,jobc,command" | egrep -i '(test|python)' | sed 's/ \/.*\// /'
75519 56180 75519    1 test.sh
75525 75519 75519    1 Python -c \012import datetime, time\012while True:\012    print("Python loop - %s" % datetime.datetime.now(), flush=True)\012    time.sleep(2)\012
...

$ kill -SIGINT 75519                # &lt;=== send SIGTERM to the parent process

$ kill -SIGINT 75525                # &lt;=== send SIGTERM to the child
[1]+  Exit 1                  ./test.sh &gt; test.out 2&gt;&amp;1

$
</pre>

<p>
The <code>test.out</code> indicates the script didn't respond to the signal until I sent
SIGINT to the child (python) process. Once the child aborted because of
SIGINT, the parent ran the trap.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Python loop - 2020-02-13 16:09:59.676853
Python loop - 2020-02-13 16:10:01.677777
Python loop - 2020-02-13 16:10:03.679282
Python loop - 2020-02-13 16:10:05.680427
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyboardInterrupt
Received SIGINT
</pre>

<p>
So, the parent did receive the signal but would not run the trap until the
child process completed? Exactly! In fact, if you review the <code>test.out</code> of
previous tests you'll find the child process always quit before the parent.
Why? This is actually clearly documented in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Signals.html#Signals">Bash Manual</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If Bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a
trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Signals.html#Signals">Bash Manual</a> also says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the wait builtin, the
reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait
builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128,
immediately after which the trap is executed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
How does <code>wait</code> change the behaviour of the parent process and the child
process? I'd leave it for you to figure out.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Why <code>kill -SIGINT pid_of_parent</code> does not work the same as pressing Ctrl-c?
</p>

<p>
Now we understand why the parent process didn't exit immediately when we sent
it a SIGINT via <code>kill -SIGINT pid</code>. But, why in the first test we were able to
interrupt both the parent and the child by pressing Ctrl-c?
</p>

<p>
The reason is: actually Ctrl-c sends SIGINT to not a process a process group.
Therefore, when we press Ctrl-c, both the child and parent receive the signal,
causing the child and parent exit in turn. To achieve the same using <code>kill</code>,
please send the signal to the process group instead using <code>kill -SIGHUP --
  -pgid</code>. In the following example, both the script and the python process
belong to process group 77210, therefore <code>kill -SIGINT -- -77210</code> did the trick.
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ ./test.sh &gt;test.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
[1] 77210

$ ps -eo "pid,ppid,pgid,jobc,command" | egrep -i '(test|python)' | sed 's/ \/.*\// /'
77210 56180 77210    1 test.sh
77216 77210 77210    1 Python -c \012import datetime, time\012while True:\012    print("Python loop - %s" % datetime.datetime.now(), flush=True)\012    time.sleep(2)\012
..

$ kill -SIGINT -- -77210
[1]+  Exit 1                  ./test.sh &gt; test.out 2&gt;&amp;1
