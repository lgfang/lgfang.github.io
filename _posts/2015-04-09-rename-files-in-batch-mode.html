Once for a while, we need to rename a number of files. This can of course be
easily done with a trivial shell script (or in Emacs dird mode). However, in
fact, there is already an even handier command line tool called <code>rename</code> to cope
with that.
</p>

<p>
The usage is simple. To rename string "from" to "to" in file1, file2 etc.,
simply run
</p>
<pre class="example">
rename from to file1 file2 ...
</pre>

<p>
In fact, we do not usually explicitly list every file to be renamed since we
have file name glob!. Here is an example which renames all html files' extension
from ".html" to ".htm".
</p>
<pre class="example">
rename html htm *.html
</pre>

<p>
Please note that this tool does not only work with suffix. It replaces the
"from" string in any place in the file names. See the below for an example.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ ls *env*
smallenv.beg1  smallenv.beg2  smallenv.common  smallenv.proxyg1  smallenv.proxyg2
$ rename small set *env*
$ ls *env*
setenv.beg1  setenv.beg2  setenv.common  setenv.proxyg1  setenv.proxyg2
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Caveat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
You should be really cautious with "unexpected" occurrence of "from" string in
file names since "rename" replaces the first and only the first occurrence of
"from" in the file names. Note that in the following example the file name
suffix is NOT changed.
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ ls
how_html_generated.html

$ rename html htm *

$ ls
how_htm_generated.html
</pre>
</div>
</div>
