<p>
Familiar with the command "find" I might be, I was not aware of the option
<code>-iname</code> until recently. What a shame!

<p>
The <code>-iname</code> is very much the same as <code>-name</code> except that the match is case
insensitive. Though I may stick to <code>-name</code> in my scripts, I will definitely opt
for <code>-iname</code> when working in an interactive terminal.
