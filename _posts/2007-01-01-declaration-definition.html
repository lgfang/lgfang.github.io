The terminologies "definition" and "declaration" in this article are adopted
from <span class="underline">The C++ Programming Language (Special edition)</span> (_TC++PL_ for short). In
<span class="underline">C: A Reference Manual</span> (_Reference_ for short) they are called "defining
declaration" and "referencing declaration" respectively.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-1">Why Care</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Distinguishing definitions from declarations are important since header files
containing definitions could cause subtle problems. For example:
</p>

<p>
If a header file which contains a definition is included by more than one
source files, each translation unit will get its own copy of that definition
after preprocessing. The best result you may expect is that you'll get
"multiple definition" error on linkage (except for ODR in C++). But there are
also chances that compiler silently give you multiple instances of the
variable. So it's always better to not put any definition in header files
except for "const" variables and ODR (refer to Section 9.2.1 of <span class="underline">TC++PL</span> for
more about what a header files should/shouldn't contain) .
</p>

<p>
This article is based on <span class="underline">Reference</span> and <span class="underline">TC++PL</span>. It reflects the test
results of gcc and g++ of version (GCC) 3.2.3 20030502 (Red Hat Linux
3.2.3-20). However, according to <span class="underline">Reference</span>, other C compiler's behavior may
differ.

<h2 id="sec-2">Confusing Statements</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The most confusing statements (which are also where differences
between C and C++ exist) are following two kinds of statements:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>;
<span class="org-keyword">extern</span> <span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For the first one, it is a definition in C++. In C the situation is rather
complicated. The statement is deemed as a declaration if there is a definition
in the same translation unit. Otherwise compiler will automatically define an
<code>i</code> for you. <b>But On linkage, variables defined by that means will be dealt
with specially</b>. <span class="underline">Reference</span> says that different compilers may choose
different rules. According to test, GCC chooses which is called "Mixed Common
Model" (4.8.4) by <span class="underline">Reference</span>. That is: if there are more than one translation
unit contains such definition for <code>i</code>, those definitions will be combined into
only one definition. Note how that is different from other kinds of
definitions: multiple-definition is just illegal.
</p>

<p>
As for the second one, it is illegal in C. But in C++, the <code>extern</code> is
silently ignored.
</p>

<p>
For a full discussion on C/C++ compatibility for declaration (of a more
general sense), please refer to section 4.9 of <span class="underline">Reference</span>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Clearer Ones</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In fact, there are more clear statements. They mean the same in C/C++ as well.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All initializations (i.e. statements like following one) are definitions.
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0;                      <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">definition</span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>All <code>extern</code> statements (except for the one discussed above) are declarations.
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-keyword">extern</span> <span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>;                   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">declarations</span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>For functions and structures, following are declarations:
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-keyword">struct</span> <span class="org-type">s</span>;
<span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">f</span>();
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Section 9.2.3 of <span class="underline">TC++PL</span> detailed <span class="underline">One Definition Rule (ODR)</span>. The ODR says
that definitions of "class", "inline function", "template" can be repeated <b>if
and only if</b> in different translation unit. <span class="underline">Reference</span> doesn't mention any
rule alike. Nor did I find a way to test.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Advice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Avoid following statements, especially the first one:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>;
<span class="org-keyword">extern</span> <span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Instead, using following kinds of statements for declarations and
definitions respectively whenever possible:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0; <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">initialization for definition</span>
<span class="org-keyword">extern</span> <span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>; <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">"extern" for declaration</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Why?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Those two kinds of statement are more portable not only between C and C++
but also among C compilers.
</li>

<li>Using initialization for definition helps to develop a good habit of
initialize a variable when defining it: although compiler will initialize
global variables for you, that is not the case for automatic variables.
</li>
</ul>
