<p>
The first glance at the following examples may make you think the <code>[</code> works as
expected while the impelmentation of <code>[[</code> has a bug. However, examining it more
closely, you will find the later was designed to act that way and it is, in my
opinion, a better design.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell-script">$ ls
abcd

$ <span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">WRONG, but returns "expected result"</span>
$ [ -f abc* ] &amp;&amp; <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> found || <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> not found
found

$ <span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">CORRECT, but returns "unexpected result"</span>
$ [[ -f abc* ]] &amp;&amp; <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> found || <span class="org-builtin">echo</span> not found
not found
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As for <code>[</code>, it will expand "abc*" according to filename glob, which means the
resulted expression can be <code>[ -f ]</code> or <code>[ -f abc1 abc2 ... ]</code>. Therefore, even
though in this case it returns expected expression, it is incorrect. Moreover,
this kind of errors are hard to reproduce elsewhere (although those who have
clear understanding of shell expansion can sense the issue at a glimpse).
</p>

<p>
In contrast, <code>[[</code> will NOT expand "abc*". Even though it might be
"counter-intuitive" to many (as they would expect a filename glob expansion), it
is a better design because it eliminates the aformentioned risk.
