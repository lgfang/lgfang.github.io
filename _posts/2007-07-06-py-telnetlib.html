title: Meaning of Read Functions in telnetlib

<p>
Recently, I was writing a test script using telnetlib of Python. However, the
family of read functions can be really confusing, say, what is lazy read, what
is eager read? Neither Python document nor google gives many clue. Fortunately,
the library is open-source and very easy to follow. Here is what I got after
reading the source.

<p>
To understand the meaning of each read function in the telnetlib, we need to
understand how telnetlib works. First, telnetlib receives packets from
internet using socket connections. Then, it stores the data into its raw
queue. After that, the library cooks (parse/handle) the data according to
telnet protocol, putting result into its cooked queue.
