If you have a Garmin smart watch and are looking for a way to merge multiple
activities into one because you accidentaly/mistakenly saved one activity when
you meant to pause it, this article is or you.
</p>

<p>
What I wanted to merge activities, google told me that i) Garmin does not
provide this kind of functionality. <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/59993/merge-activities-feature">Someone has requested this feature over 9
years ago</a> but there has no progress yet. Some third party tools/web sites claim
to be able to do this task. But, somehow the two websites I tried did not work
(or maybe I did it incorrectly). Luckily I found it could be easily done using
any text editor. Below is how to do it:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Firstly, login to the garmin connect website from your laptop/desktop and
find the activities to be merged.</li>

<li><p>
Then, export the activities to TCX:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://lgfang.github.io/images/garmin_merge_export.png" alt="garmin_merge_export.png" />
</p>
</div></li>

<li><p>
After that, open the TCX file for the first activity using your favoriate text
editor. You'll see an XML file similar to the one below. As you can see, the
activity specific information is recorded as a <b>Lap</b> element.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://lgfang.github.io/images/garmin_merge_before.png" alt="garmin_merge_before.png" />
</p>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Now, copy the <b>Lap</b> elements from other TCX files and append them into the
above file and save it. The file should look like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://lgfang.github.io/images/garmin_merge_after.png" alt="garmin_merge_after.png" />
</p>
</div></li>

<li>Lastly, import the modified file into garmin connect. After verifying the
merged activity is correct, delete the original ones.</li>
</ol>
