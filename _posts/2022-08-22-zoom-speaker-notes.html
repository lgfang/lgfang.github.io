So you have a presentation with detailed speaker notes. You'll present it via
Zoom. You have only one monitor. Then you may find yourself in this dilemma: if
you share the slides in Zoom, you won't be able to see the speaker notes; if you
share the speaker notes in Zoom, everyone in the Zoom can see the speaker notes
as well.

I couldn't find an perfect solution but here is a workaround. Hope it helps.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In Zoom, share your desktop with "Advanced &gt; Portion of Screen" as shown in
the above screenshot.</li>
<li>Arrange your speak notes and the slides side by side (if your presentation
tool/framework does not do that automatically).</li>
<li>Adjust the shared area to cover only the slides part.

<li>You are good to go.</li>
</ol>
