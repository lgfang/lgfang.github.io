<a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> is technically a superset of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>. While YAML is more human friendly than
JSON, JSON is easier and faster to parse. Therefore, it is recommended to use
YAML for configure files, JSON for APIs. And that is why MongoDB choose YAML for
configure file while it already has to parse JSON in the first place.

<p>
JSON is much less human editable than YAML. It is also a little less human
readable than YAML, although it much better than XML. JSON does not support
comments, which can be really important in configure files. Complex datatypes is
also a strength of YAML.
