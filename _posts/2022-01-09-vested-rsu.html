While the stock price of my employer has gone up multiple folds since IPO and
the trend may continue for some time, I recently decided to sell the RSUs once
they are vested. Yestoday, I came across this blog, which suggests that my
decision does make sense. If you are also considering what to do with your
vested RSUs, I'd highly recommend you have a look at this article as well.
Although different your choice might be, understanding the underlying logic and
making your decision a well informed one should be beneficial.

</ul>

<p>
To summarize, since RSUs are taxed on the dates when they are vested, keeping
all the vested RSUs is like buying these RSUs using all cash bonus. It is
interesting that many people choose to keep vested RSUs even though they
understand that but they won't spend all cash bonus to buy company shares should
they are given cash bonus. The reason is <b>cognitive dissonance</b> caused by
<b>regret aversion</b>.

<p>
Having said that, it is totally legit to keep some or all the vested RSUs based
the outlook for the company. But, please keep in mind that even all vested RSUs
are sold you still have your long term position: RSUs not vested yet.
