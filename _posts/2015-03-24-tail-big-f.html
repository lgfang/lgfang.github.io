<p>
For the <code>tail</code>, there is option <code>-f</code> and there is option <code>-F</code>. Which one to use?
What is the difference? Most of the time, I use <code>-F</code> since it works with log
rotation etc.
</p>

<p>
<code>-F</code> is equivalent to <code>--follow=name --retry</code>. It is useful when log files would
be renamed or deleted, which is not uncommon in systems with log rotation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This option ensures that we are following the latest log. In contrast, if we
use <code>tail -f log_file</code>, we will be following that particular file even if it
is renamed to <code>log_file.1</code> or deleted and hence miss new log messages.
</li>

<li>Another cool thing about <code>-F</code> is that you can launch the tail command before
log files are created.
</li>
</ul>
